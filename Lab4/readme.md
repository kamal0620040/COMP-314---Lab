COMP 314: Algorithms and Complexity
Lab work 4: Knapsack problem

1 Purpose
Solving Knapsack problem using different algorithm design strategies.

2 Tasks
Solve the Knapsack problem using the following strategies:
1. Brute-force method (Both fractional and 0/1 Knapsack)
2. Greedy method (Fractional Knapsack)
3. [Bonus] Dynamic programming (0/1 Knapsack)
You must submit pseudocodes for each of these methods along with the
source code of your program (and test cases).
