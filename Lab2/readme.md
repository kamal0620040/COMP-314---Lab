COMP 314: Algorithms and Complexity

Lab work 2: Sorting

1 Purpose
Implementation, testing and performance measurement of sorting algorithms.

2 Tasks
Students are required to accomplish the following tasks preferably in Python.

1. Implement the following sorting algorithms:
(a) Insertion sort
(b) Merge sort

2. Write some test cases to test your program.

3. Generate some random inputs for your program and apply both insertion
sort and merge sort algorithms to sort the generated sequence of data.
Record the execution times of both algorithms for inputs of different size.
Plot an input-size vs execution-time graph.

4. Explain your observations.


### Run Locally

<strong>Note: You need to have python installed in your computer.<strong>

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kamal0620040/COMP-314---Lab
```

Go to the Lab 2 directory

```bash
  cd Lab2
```

Create Python virtual environment here:
 
 ```bash
  python3 -m venv your-virtual-env-name
 ```

Activate virtual environment

For: windows
 ```bash
  your-virtual-env-name\Scripts\activate
 ```

Install the requirement required

 ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

Now, you can run the python file you want

```bash
  python filename.py
```
